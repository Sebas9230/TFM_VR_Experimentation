# üéÆ Vive Controller Binding Setup (SteamVR Plugin Branch)

## ‚ùó Why this is important

This configuration file is **required for proper movement and interaction in the VR environment** when using the **SteamVR plugin branch** of the project. It defines **custom input bindings** for the HTC Vive controllers, enabling features such as:

- Walking/movement input  
- UI interaction

Without this configuration, the default SteamVR bindings **will not trigger** the necessary in-game actions, and the VR experience may not function correctly.
